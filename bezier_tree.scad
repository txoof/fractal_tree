This library uses psuedo-random bezier curves to generate a 2D vector drawing of a tree.
There are *many* paramaters that can be adjusted to produce different trees.

-Aaron Ciuffo (reach me at Gmail: aaron.ciuffo)

=======
To use this within another OpenSCAD design try:
`
use </Path/To/This/File/bezier_tree.scad>

trunk();
`

Here are three examples all grown from the same "seed" but with tweaks to the parameters
to produce three very different trees.

To produce a tree simliar to a birch tree (thin, tall, quickly diminishing,  
and straight) try the following settings:
`
trunk(size = 900, bend = 25, seed = 40, depth = 12, widthBottom = 100, widthTop = 90, 
      maxAngle = 45, minAngle = 35, branchProb = [40, 20, 10], 
      maxGrowth = .9, minGrowth = .9, decay = .85);
`

To produce a tree similar to a gnarled old oak (thick, branching horizontally, with
a bushy crown) try the following settings:
    trunk(size = 600, bend = 150, seed = 40, widthBottom = 300, widthTop = 280, 
          maxAngle = 75, minAngle = 55, branchProb = [20, 50], 
          maxGrowth = 1.0, decay = .93, depth = 6);

A reasonable poppler (tall, stright, fast growing and vertical) can be prodced with
these settings:

    trunk(size = 1500, bend = 100, seed = 40, widthBottom = 300, widthTop = 280,        maxAngle = 15, minAngle = 15, branchProb = [10, 50], 
        maxGrowth = 1.0, decay = .93, depth = 6);


To produce a tree of a particular dimension use:

    resize([0, 0, 500], auto = true) //resize to a height of 500
    trunk(size = 1500, bend = 100, seed = 40, widthBottom = 300, widthTop = 280, 
          maxAngle = 15, minAngle = 15, branchProb = [10, 50, 30], 
          maxGrowth = 1.0, decay = .93, depth = 6);

###Design Considerations###
To create more bent branches increase the bend/size ratio. size = 500, bend = 250 will 
make a VERY twisted tree

Setting depth above 9 can result in very long excution times as the recursion grows
exponentially with depth
